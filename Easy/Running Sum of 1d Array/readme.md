# Sum of Array

This code imports the java.util.Arrays library and then creates a Solution class with a runningSum method that takes an array of integers as an argument. This method iterates through the array and adds each element to a sum variable, then sets the element in the array to be equal to the sum. Finally, it returns the modified array. The Main class then creates an instance of Solution and passes an array of integers to its runningSum method, which is printed out using Arrays.toString().

## Time and Space Complexity

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)
