# Pivot index

This code is a solution to the problem of finding the pivot index in an array. The pivot index is the index where the sum of all elements to the left of it equals the sum of all elements to the right of it. The Solution class contains a method called pivotIndex which takes an array of integers as an argument and returns the index of the pivot element if it exists, or -1 if it does not exist. The main method creates an instance of Solution and calls its pivotIndex method on an array {2, 1, -1}, printing out its result.

## Time and Space complexity

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(1)
